# Angular To-Do App 📝

---

## Overview

- This Angular To-Do App is a personal portfolio project and my learning canvas for mastering modern Angular concepts. I built this project to consolidate my understanding of core Angular topics, including:

- Standalone Components and modular architecture

- Routing (nested routes, lazy loading)

- Reactive Forms for task creation and editing

- Services and Dependency Injection

- HTTP Interceptors for authentication and error handling

- RxJS streams and state management with Observables and Subjects

- Signals for reactive state in Angular

- SCSS Styling with modern design patterns

- The goal was not only to create a working To-Do app but also to have a real project demonstrating best practices in Angular development.

## Features
- **Task Listing** – View all tasks in a clean, responsive grid with visual indicators for status and priority.  
- **Task Creation & Editing** – Add new tasks or edit existing ones with a reactive form and real-time validation.  
- **Task Status Toggle** – Quickly mark tasks as done or pending directly from the task list.  
- **Task Deletion** – Remove tasks permanently with a single action, updating the list immediately.  
- **Demo & Authentication Simulation** – Simulated login/logout system to demonstrate route guards and conditional UI.  
- **Error Handling** – Centralized HTTP error interception with user-friendly notifications for connectivity or authorization issues.
